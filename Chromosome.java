But when I try to use 'more_items.txt' I get a chromosome with all of it's items set as true as the best possible answer even though the fitness is 0. I couldn't figure it out and was stumped on it the longest out of all of this... I believe it boils down to my compareTo() or getFitness() method. I'm not sure how it would be anything else. Insteaad of going off of the fitness numbers it goes off of the amount of items the chromosome has even if the fitness is equal to 0... Can you please explain or help me understand what I did wrong in the feedback?
